# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock

A simple bot to play this game, following ideas from [this article](https://www.his.se/PageFiles/8158/Henrik_Engstrom.pdf).

The rules are given by Sheldon in episode 8 of season 2 of TBBT (The Big Bang Theory).

Winning should be difficult after a few dozens of rounds, because it's hard to play at random.

Setting "draw is lost" and/or increasing number of inputs can improve bot level.
